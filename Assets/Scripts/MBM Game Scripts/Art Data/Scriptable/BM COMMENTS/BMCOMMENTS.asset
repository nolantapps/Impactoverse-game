    - 'The group of artists known as "The Boys of Glasgow" started without any girls!  '
    - 'But then, a woman named Flora MacDonald Reid, who was married to John Reid
      (one of the artists whose work you can see in the exhibition), became important
      in their early days. Later on, in the 1890s, more young women started to become
      famous too, and they were called the "Glasgow Girls." This name was only given
      to them in 1988!  '
    - 'For the first time, these pioneering women artists were shown alongside their
      male friends. But they had to face many challenges because it was hard for
      women to be recognised as artists back then. '
    - "Even though I always saw myself as a professional artist, I was never officially
      acknowledged that way. When I died on March 2, 1895, my death certificate didn\u2019t
      even list me as an artist. "

    - 'The Girls and Boys of Glasgow were initially only known as The Boys of Glasgow. '
    - 'One woman, Flora MacDonald Reid, the wife of John Reid, whose work you can
      see in the exhibition, featured significantly in the early years. A younger
      generation, now known as the Glasgow Girls, came to prominence in the 1890s.
      The term was coined much later in 1988! '
    - For the first time the pioneering women appeared alongside their male contemporaries.
      But it also revealed the challenges faced by women seeking to forge careers
      as artists.
    - "Myself, despite having always positioned myself as a professional artist,
      never received that accolade during my lifetime. On March 2, 1895, I died,
      \u201Csans profession,\u201D according to the official parlance of my death
      certificate. "
