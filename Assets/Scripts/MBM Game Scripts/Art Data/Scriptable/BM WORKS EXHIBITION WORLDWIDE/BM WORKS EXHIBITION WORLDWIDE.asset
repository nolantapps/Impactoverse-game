    - "When she died on 2 March 1895, Berthe Morisot\u2019s work was still little
      known. It was mainly shown at Impressionist exhibitions. Rarely exhibited,
      her paintings were not often found on the market.So,when the French State began
      acquiring Impressionist paintings in the early 20th century, Morisot\u2019s
      were difficult to find However, her daughter Julie\u2019s husband Ernest Rouart
      and their subsequent descendants promoted all of her work. "
    - "Nevertheless, as the \u201Cfirst woman Impressionist\u201D.her work was exhibited
      abroad. In the United States, art enthusiasts took an early interest in her
      work and museums began to add her paintings to their collections regularly
      from the late 1920s onwards. And since the 2000s, Japanese museums have brought
      together a number of pieces, thus adding to the artist\u2019s renown and confirming
      the new interest\_in\_her\_work."
