      gently on your knees. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to center
      yourself. '
    - 'Controlled Breathing: Begin with deep breathing, inhale for two counts (stomach
      then chest), hold for one count, and exhale for four counts. Focus on your
      breathing as it naturally slows down.'
    - 'Deepening Relaxation: Mentally scan your body, releasing any tension as you
      move from your head down to your toes. Allow your body to feel heavy and completely
      relaxed. '
    - 'Alpha Focus Visualisation: Visualise yourself in the natural park of Ginkgo
      lab., surrounded by tranquility. Focus on slowing your brain activity and imagine
      your thoughts moving slowly, as if floating gently on water.'
    - 'Enter Alpha State: Direct your attention inward. Let go of any distracting
      thoughts, focusing instead on the peacefulness within. Maintain a light but
      focused awareness, allowing yourself to enter a calm, relaxed mental state
      associated with alpha brainwaves. '
