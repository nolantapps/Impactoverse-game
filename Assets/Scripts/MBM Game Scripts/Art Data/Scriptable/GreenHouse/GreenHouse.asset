    - 'Welcome to the 19th-century Dutch greenhouse! This greenhouse was a very important
      place in the park. Seeds were planted here, fragile flowers like fuchsias spent
      the winter inside, and plants were repotted to grow stronger. All what was
      grown was for the people living on the property to enjoy. A fertile land, the
      Seine Valley around Bougival was famous for feeding Paris with its gardeners
      and farmers. Berthe and her family enjoyed it too. '
    - 'Yvonne - who adopted Raka the Grey Parrot as you remember and who lived in
      Maison C, came here at least twice a day to check the temperature and water
      the plants. She kept doing this until the incredible age of 103, which kept
      her fit and independent.  '
    - "Remember: go outside often, stay active, and enjoy the fresh air! Now, try
      to find Maison C. Here\u2019s a clue: its name starts with the letter C."

    - "This is the 19th-century Dutch greenhouse, an essential part of the park.
      This greenhouse played a key role in the park\u2019s lifecycle. Seeds were
      planted here, fragile plants like fuchsias wintered here, and repotting prepared
      plants for the next season. Whilst this was for the occupants\u2019 consumption
      and enjoyment, the Seine Valley around Bougival was very fertile and once a
      major agricultural hub, where gardeners and farmers grew fruits and vegetables
      for Paris. Berthe Morisot, her family and visiting friends will have enjoyed
      it too. "
    - 'Yvonne, who lived in Maison C, visited this greenhouse at least twice a day
      to check the temperature and water the plants. She maintained this routine
      until the incredible age of 103, which helped her stay independent and healthy.  '
    - "Remember, it\u2019s important to go outdoors and stay active! Now, continue
      your journey: find Maison C. Hint: its name starts with the letter C."
