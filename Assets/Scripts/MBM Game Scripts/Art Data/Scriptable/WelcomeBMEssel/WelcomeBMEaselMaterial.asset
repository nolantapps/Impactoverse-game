    - 'Embrace Your Imagination '
    - "Impressionist artists loved drawing because it let them capture quick impressions
      of the world around them. They didn\u2019t just stick to one method: they liked
      to mix things up! Instead of only using paint, they combined watercolors, pastels,
      and even crayons to create striking and colorful scenes. The Impressionists
      didn\u2019t worry about making their art perfect; they focused on showing how
      a place or moment felt.  "
    - "Try using whatever you have (pens, pencils, felt pens\u2026) to paint something
      from what you see in nature or from your imagination. Remember, there are no
      rules, just have fun! "

    _ArtDetail:
    - Experiment with Techniques and Supports
    - "The Impressionists were dedicated to the art of drawing, believing it was
      essential for capturing life\u2019s fleeting moments. However, they took a
      relaxed approach, often mixing media and experimenting with unconventional
      supports and formats. This led to unique combinations like watercolor with
      gouache, tempera on unusual surfaces, and even using fans as canvases. By blending
      techniques and letting go of rigid structure, they created some of the most
      memorable and dynamic art of their time.  "
    - 'Try applying this mindset by combining materials in your own work, perhaps
      start with a charcoal or sanguine sketch, then add a layer of pastel or watercolour.
      Challenge yourself to capture not just what you see, but also what you feel. '
