    - "For Impressionists like Berthe Morisot, letters provided a reflective space
      to convey emotions and document life in a way that paintings couldn't. Berthe
      and her family lived in Bougival, where she often described the landscapes
      and her daughter\u2019s playful nature. Use this storytelling exercise to immerse
      yourself in the epistolary tradition. Like Berthe, bring to life the scenes
      you\u2019ve experienced or imagined through letters or narratives that capture
      the mood of the moment. "
    - "Berthe wrote: \u201CNothing forms one\u2019s style more effectively than recording
      thoughts daily, not to turn out fine phrases, but to put one\u2019s thoughts
      into words, with real feelings and personal ideas.\u201D (1884)\u200B "
    - "In another letter, Berthe expresses her frustrations about the challenges
      of balancing her art with motherhood and family obligations: \u201CThere is
      a great deal to do, and I hardly know how to get around to painting.\u201D
      There is no coincidence why she mostly painted at home in family settings,
      on small formats and with a swift technique."
