    - 'During the 19th century, people often shared their feelings and stories through
      letters. Berthe wrote daily letters to her friends and family, people she cared
      about, sharing both her happiness and frustrations. She often talked about
      her daughter, Julie, and the joy she brought to her life. '
    - "Berthe wrote to her sister Edma: \u201CMy daughter is like a kitten always
      happy. She likes to laugh and play so much! She is round as a ball, with little
      sparkling eyes and a large grinning mouth.\u201D "
    - "At the age of ten, Julie began writing her 'memoirs' but it wasn\u2019t until
      August 1893, at fourteen, that Julie began her diary in earnest: no neat leather-bound
      volume with lock and key but just untidy notes scribbled in old exercise books,
      often in pencil, the presentation as spontaneous as its contents. "
    - 'Just like Berthe and Julie, you can write a story or a letter describing your
      day or your artwork, using simple, heartfelt words. '
    - "Try writing your own short story or letter today, imagining yourself in Julie\u2019s
      time. What would you share with a friend about your day? What would you write
      to your family about your dreams for the future? "

    - "For Impressionists like Berthe Morisot, letters provided a reflective space
      to convey emotions and document life in a way that paintings couldn't. Berthe
      and her family lived in Bougival, where she often described the landscapes
      and her daughter\u2019s playful nature. Use this storytelling exercise to immerse
      yourself in the epistolary tradition. Like Berthe, bring to life the scenes
      you\u2019ve experienced or imagined through letters or narratives that capture
      the mood of the moment. "
    - "Berthe wrote: \u201CNothing forms one\u2019s style more effectively than recording
      thoughts daily, not to turn out fine phrases, but to put one\u2019s thoughts
      into words, with real feelings and personal ideas.\u201D (1884)\u200B"
    - "In another letter, Berthe expresses her frustrations about the challenges
      of balancing her art with motherhood and family obligations: \u201CThere is
      a great deal to do, and I hardly know how to get around to painting.\u201D
      There is no coincidence why she mostly painted at home in family settings,
      on small formats and with a swift technique."
    - "Julie started writing her \"memoirs\" at age 10 aware that she was growing
      up in a famous artistic family, but it wasn\u2019t until she was 14, in August
      1893, that she began keeping a diary more seriously. Her entries were not crafted
      in a polished, leather-bound volume, but rather in untidy notes scribbled in
      old exercise books, often in pencil. The informal presentation of her diary
      mirrored the spontaneity of its contents, offering a raw and vivid look into
      her life and the cultural atmosphere of late 19th-century France. "
    - Write your own reflection or letter. You might explore how art, technology,
      or society has changed in your lifetime, or how the interaction between these
      fields might shape the future.
    - 'Use the format of a letter or diary entry to express personal reflections. '

    - You've arrived at this exciting phase of your journey
    - 'In this space, you can explore two distinct forms of creativity: painting
