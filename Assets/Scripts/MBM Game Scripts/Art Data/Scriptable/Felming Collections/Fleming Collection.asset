      1968 by Flemings Bank to help keep Scottish art safe and remembered.  '
    - Even though there's no proof that I ever met the "Girls and Boys of Glasgow,"

    - 'The Glasgow Girls and Boys were a group of rebellious young artists who became
      famous in the early 1880s for painting real-life scenes in the countryside.
      There were about 20 painters in this group, including John Lavery, Bessie MacNicol,
      Edward Hornel, Alexander Roche, and James Guthrie. '
