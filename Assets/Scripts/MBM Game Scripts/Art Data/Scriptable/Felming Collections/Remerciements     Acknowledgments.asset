    _ArtDetail:
    - 'This exhibition is the culmination of the collaborative efforts, dedication,
      and expertise of four curators and the institutions they represent. '
    - Theodore Albano, Director of the Fleming-Wyfold Art Foundation, has offered
      his profound knowledge of The Glasgow Girls & Boys group and provided us with
      the remarkable works you see today.
    - 'Marianne Magnin, Founder of The Cornelius Arts Foundation (TCAF), Gingko lab.
      and Strategic Partner at Longhouse has been the driving force behind this project
      from inception to completion. Her visionary leadership, belief in the transformative
      power of the arts, and innovative R&D work at Gingko lab. were instrumental
      in making the exhibition a reality. Without her unwavering dedication this
      project would not come to fruition. '
