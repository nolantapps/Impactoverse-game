    _ArtDetail:
    - 'In the 1880s, a group of about 15 young artists in Glasgow (Scotland) became
      known as the "Glasgow Boys." They painted scenes of everyday life in the countryside,
      showing it just as it was. They got ideas from new styles of French painting
      and made friends in art communities in France and Scotland. They were rebels! '
    - 'While most of the early artists were men, one woman named Flora Macdonald
      Reid was also important. Later, in the 1890s, another group of talented women
      artists, now called the "Glasgow Girls," came onto the scene. They weren''t
      called this at the time; the name was given to them during an exhibition in
      1988 to honor these amazing, but often forgotten, women artists. '
    - You will discover 5 of these artists in the exhibition.

    _ArtDetail:
    - 'The moniker ''Glasgow Boys'' dates back to the mid-1880s when a group of around
      15 young artists came to prominence in Glasgow as documentary painters of rural
      life in all its stark reality, having, broadly speaking, coalesced through
      friendships made at artists'' colonies in France and Scotland fed by a shared
      awareness of international trends, especially in cutting-edge French Naturalist
      painting. Their rebellious spirit was evident in their departure from conventional
      academic styles, embracing instead a more modern, realist approach that was
      considered radical at the time. '
    - 'Only one woman, Flora Macdonald Reid, featured significantly in these early
      years, while a younger generation, now known as the Glasgow Girls, came to
      prominence in the 1890s. They were not known then by that name, which was coined
      in 1988 as the title of an exhibition at Glasgow School of Art which shone
      the spotlight on a long-forgotten group of brilliant women artists and designers. '
    - 'Five of these artists are featured in the exhibition: Edward Hornel, William
      MacGeorge, John Reid, Alexander Roche and  William Yule.'
