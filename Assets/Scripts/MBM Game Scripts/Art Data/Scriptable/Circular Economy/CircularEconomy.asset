    - The park of Ginkgo Lab. is an amazing place where humans and animals lived
      in harmony in a magical, balanced circle. There was a greenhouse, two vegetable
      gardens, orchards full of fruits, and spaces for animals like Raka the parrot,
      dogs (who had their kennel but were free to roam), cats, chickens, rabbits,
      geese, a donkey, sheep, a pig, and even guinea pigs!
    - 'In the woods, there were always things to forage and smell: wild strawberries,
      mushrooms, nuts, walnuts, and fallen wood for making open fires and bake potatoes
      in the ashes. It was a paradise for discovery, especially for children, with
      something to snack on or explore at every turn. '
    - 'Nothing was wasted here: preserves and jam filled up the shelves, leftover
      meals fed the dogs, vegetable tops were given to the rabbits, chickens ate
      organic scraps, fallen wood heated homes, and compost enriched the gardens.
      Everything had a purpose.'
    - What could you recycle or reuse in your daily life?

    _ArtDetail:
    - "The park of Ginkgo lab. is a fascinating model of a circular ecosystem. The
      property included a greenhouse, two vegetable gardens, fruit orchards, and
      spaces for domesticated animals like Raka the parrot, dogs (who had their kennel
      but roamed freely), cats, chickens, rabbits, geese, a donkey, sheep, a pig,
      and even guinea pigs. The surrounding woods below Parc de la Jonqui\xE8re were
      rich with wild strawberries, mushrooms, nuts, walnuts, and fallen wood for
      making open fires and bake potatoes in the ashes."
    - 'For both children and adults, there was always something to snack on or discover,
      with varied scents filling the air. Nothing was wasted: preserves and jam filled
      up the shelves, leftover meals fed the dogs, vegetable tops went to the rabbits,
      chickens consumed organic scraps, fallen wood was used for heating, and compost
      enriched the soil for the gardens. Every resource was carefully used.'
    - How could you integrate these circular practices into your life to reduce waste
      and reconnect with nature?"
