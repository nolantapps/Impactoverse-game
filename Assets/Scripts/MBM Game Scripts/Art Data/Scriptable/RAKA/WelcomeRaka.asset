    _ArtDetail:
    - Once upon a time in Bougival, there was a Congo grey parrot named Raka. He
      had traveled a long way from Africa on a ship, brought by a captain as a gift
      for his aunt, Yvonne, who lived in a big house called Maison C.
    - Yvonne named the parrot "Raka," after a princess from The Thousand and One
      Nights. The name came from ancient tales, full of adventure and mystery, and
      it seemed perfect for this young parrot with a distant and unknown past.
    - "Raka was young and wild when he first arrived, just 6 months old, and he missed
      the forests of his homeland. But Yvonne\u2019s daughter, Jenny, decided to
      care for him and teach him to feel at home. Slowly, Raka grew to trust Jenny.
      He loved her so much that he would sit on her shoulder, and he even shared
      sunflower seeds with her\u2014a sign of his deep affection"
    - "Raka was a clever parrot. He could imitate voices in the house, answer the
      phone by saying, \"All\xF4, ici le 14,\" and whistle beautiful tunes. Jenny
      and Raka spent many peaceful moments together. She would walk to the woods
      with him, and he would fly around but always return to her. Their bond was
      special, like a silent understanding between two friends"
    - But when Jenny grew older, she moved away to start her own family. Raka became
      lonely without her and sometimes flew off for days, searching for something
      familiar. Yvonne would call Jenny back to Maison C to say his name, and only
      then would Raka return, hearing the voice he loved.
    - "One day in the 1970s, Raka flew away and didn\u2019t come back. Yvonne found
      a few grey feathers scattered in the park. Jenny was heartbroken and still
      remembers her dear friend Raka, the companion who understood her in ways only
      he could. "
    - "Today, Congo grey parrots are a protected species, and it\u2019s illegal to
      take them from their homes in the wild. They are rare and precious, just like
      the bond Jenny had with Raka."
