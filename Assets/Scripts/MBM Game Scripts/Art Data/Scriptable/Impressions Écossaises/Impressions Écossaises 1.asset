    - 'This inaugural exhibition of Scottish Impressionist paintings celebrates the
      connection between Scottish and French artists of the late 19th century. Featuring
      some of the finest works from The Glasgow Girls and Boys, on loan from the
      Fleming Collection, the exhibition explores the relationship between these
      two movements, united in their quest to capture the essence of nature and everyday
      life. Both The Glasgow Girls and Boys and Berthe Morisot share similarities
      in technique, their focus on capturing fleeting moments en plein air, and their
      emphasis on the natural world and children. '
    - "The Glasgow Boys first gained prominence in the mid-1880s when a group of
      around 15 young artists exhibited at the Glasgow gallery of art dealer Alexander
      Reid. Though lacking a formal manifesto, they were united in their desire to
      challenge the prevailing Academicism and the conventions of the Royal Scottish
      Academy. While remaining within the tradition of Scottish landscape painting,
      they drew inspiration from the freer, more vibrant style of their French counterparts,
      whom they encountered through Reid and at artists\u2019 colonies along the
      Seine, including Bougival. The group embraced a modern, realist approach they
      found in France, and their departure from conventional academic styles sparked
      a rebellion that had a lasting influence on Scotland\u2019s artistic identity.
      As chroniclers of modern life, they are now regarded as some of the most significant
      painters of the 19th century. "
    - "Five of these artists are featured in the exhibition: Edward Hornel, William
      MacGeorge, John Reid, Alexander Roche, and William Yule. The contributions
      of their female counterparts were not widely recognised until the 1980s, which
      led to the more inclusive label The Glasgow Girls and Boys. This shift in recognition
      parallels the recent reevaluation of Berthe Morisot, once seen primarily as
      Edouard Manet\u2019s muse. Morisot\u2019s pioneering role in the Impressionist
      movement was long overshadowed by her relationship with Manet, but in recent
      decades, her groundbreaking work has been rightfully acknowledged as a key
      contribution to the movement"
