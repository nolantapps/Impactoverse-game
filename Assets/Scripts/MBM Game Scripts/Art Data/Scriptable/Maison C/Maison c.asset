    - 'Ginkgo lab. is a place full of fascinating stories! This estate once belonged
      to King Louis XIV, who gave it to his favorite daughter, Mademoiselle de Blois.
      Today, a pavilion near the Seine, a section of the royal alley, a horse drinking
      point, an icehouse and a very old tree, the famous Ginkgo Biloba, nicknamed
      ''the tree with one thousand golden coins,'' remain from that time. '
    - 'The house you see, called Maison C, was built around 1830 by the Corpet family
      as a weekend retreat. Later, Cornelius and Yvonne van Droogenbroeck bought
      the house to live here year-round with their family. They also welcomed and
      hosted writers, musicians and artists like Jean-Michel Folon, who lived in
      a small house on the property before becoming famous. '
    - Can you imagine all the stories and creative moments that happened here?

    - 'Ginkgo lab. is an estate where royal history and artistic heritage intertwine.
      This estate was acquired around 1704 by Louis XIV for his favorite daughter,
      Mademoiselle de Blois. From that time, only a pavilion near the Seine, a section
      of the royal alley, a horse drinking point, an icehouse and a 300-year-old
      tree, the Ginkgo Biloba, remain. This tree is likely one of the first ginkgos
      planted in France. '
    - The main house, called Maison C, was built around 1830 by the Corpet family
      as a weekend retreat. Later, Cornelius and Yvonne van Droogenbroeck bought
      this property to live here full-time with their children. They also turned
      it into an artistic hub by hosting writers, musicians and artists, including
      Jean-Michel Folon, who lived in a side house before gaining fame.
    - How could this place, rich in history, art, and nature, inspire your own creativity?
