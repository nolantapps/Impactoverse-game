    - 'Leisure - particularly in natural settings - became increasingly important
      in 19th-century life. Leisure, particularly in natural settings, became increasingly
      important in 19th-century life. Nature became a refuge where children could
      play freely, away from the constraints of urban life. This shift in values
      is reflected in the paintings, where the natural world is not just a backdrop
      but a central element in the emotional and physical development of children. '
    - "In her letters, Berthe Morisot often mentioned her daughter Julie's playful
      nature (1882): \u201CWe took a walk with Bibi in the country, in a very pretty
      place, in a direction we have never taken together. The ground was cut by little
      streams; we had to ask the washerwomen to help us step over one of the obstacles,
      and your daughter, who is not brave, has developed such a fear that she begs
      me not to go there again. Her happy little pink face is a pleasure to look
      at and consoles me for your absence.\u201D"
    - "Julie, depicted in numerous works, was often shown in moments of contemplation
      or play, highlighting the universal experience of youth. Morisot\u2019s daughter
      also became the focus of her artistic experiments. As Anne Higonnet notes in
      her biography of the artist: \"Through Monet, Morisot had asked Rodin if he
      could give her a sculpture lesson. It seemed that paintings, drawings, and
      prints of Julie were not enough to satisfy her maternal passion: she now wanted
      a bust of her daughter. And so, one day, Rodin came to offer his guidance at
      Rue de Villejust.\" "
