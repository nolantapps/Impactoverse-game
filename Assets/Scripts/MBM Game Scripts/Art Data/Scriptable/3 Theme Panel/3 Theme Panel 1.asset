    - 'Themes of nature and childhood are at the heart of this exhibition. By the
      late 19th century, childhood began to be recognised as a stage of life deserving
      of attention and care. Artists drew inspiration from this shift, depicting
      children in natural settings. Loose brushstrokes, the vibrancy and lushness
      of their natural surroundings, and the plein air technique evoke the joy and
      spontaneity of childhood, reflecting the growing appreciation of nature as
      a space for education and leisure.  '
    - "Morisot\u2019s deep connection with her daughter Julie, most often portrayed
      in a natural setting, echoes the Scottish artists\u2019 depictions of children,
      where the simplicity of life is expressed with sensitivity and tenderness."
    - "\"My very dear Berthe,\" wrote Duchess Ad\xE8le Colonna, close friend of Morisot
      and artist who used the pseudonym \"Marcello,\" \"I hope you are working and
      producing those paintings so true in their effects that they seem to be a window
      open onto nature.\""
