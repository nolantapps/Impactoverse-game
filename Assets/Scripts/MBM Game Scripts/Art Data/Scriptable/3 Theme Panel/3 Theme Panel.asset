    _ArtDetail:
    - Born in Glasgow to a French father and Scottish mother, Roche (1861-1921) studied
      at Glasgow School of Art before moving to the Atelier Julian in Paris. Befriending
      John Lavery and William Kennedy, he joined them at Grez-sur-Loing. Roche, who
      was bi-lingual, had greater access to the wider artistic scene in France than
      his Scottish contemporaries due to their lack of French. This is reflected
      in his striking embracing of impressionist techniques.
    - 'The significance of Early Autumn, Grez (1883) with a glimpse of the bridge
      in the distance lies in its spontaneity and freedom of brushwork that owes
      more to the Impressionists such as Monet and Pissarro than to the precision
      of Bastien-Lepage. The works of both Scottish and French artists depict these
      moments of outdoor relaxation and resonate deeply today, reminding us of the
      timeless importance of nature in nurturing both body and mind, and the central
      role of children in shaping the future. '
