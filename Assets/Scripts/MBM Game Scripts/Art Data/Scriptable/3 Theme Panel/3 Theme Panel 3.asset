    - The depiction of teenage girls in the late 19th century reflects a transition
      from childhood to young adulthood, with themes of innocence, vitality, and
      the blossoming of personal identity. Artists of this era often portrayed young
      girls as symbols of beauty and purity, framed within lush natural settings
      that emphasised their connection to the environment. In works by artists like
      Berthe Morisot and her French contemporaries, the delicate age of adolescence
      is captured with tender brushstrokes and an appreciation for the emotions that
      come with it
    - "In contrast, Scottish artists such as William Yule and Edward Hornel portrayed
      teenage girls in more symbolic roles. Yule\u2019s \u201CSpring\u201D and MacGeorge\u2019s
      \u201CEcho\u201D celebrate the energy of youth, with girls emerging as figures
      of natural beauty, untamed by the constraints of adulthood. These works capture
      the purity of adolescence against the backdrop of nature\u2019s cycles, offering
      a snapshot of an era when the innocence of youth was revered in art and society.
      \u201CEcho\u201D scene in particular is shaped in the style and spirit of Renoir\u2019s
      landscapes and portraits of the 1880s."
    - The role of teenage girls in these paintings reflects a broader cultural shift
      towards recognising childhood as a distinct, cherished phase of life. It marks
      a period where the image of the young girl, full of potential and promise,
      became a central motif in art, celebrating both her inner world, further revealed
      in her diaries like Julie's, and her external beauty.
