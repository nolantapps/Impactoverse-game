    _ArtDetail:
    - "Impressionism is a way of painting that captures moments in time, like a sunny
      day or a beautiful sunset. Artists like Berthe Morisot and Claude Monet loved
      using bright colors and quick brushstrokes to show the feeling of a scene,
      as if it\u2019s happening right in front of you."
    - 'In the exhibition, you''ll see how Berthe Morisot, one of the first Impressionist
      painters, inspired artists from other countries to paint in her special way. '
    - "After exploring the exhibition, you\u2019ll get a fun lesson on how to paint
      outside just like the Impressionists \u2014 or in your own style \u2014 and
      enter your artwork in an international exhibition! "

    _ArtDetail:
    - 'Impressionism, emerging in the late 19th century, was a groundbreaking movement
      that broke away from traditional art forms. Pioneers like Berthe Morisot and
      Claude Monet focused on depicting the fleeting effects of light and color,
      often painting en plein air to capture the immediacy of the natural world.
      Their works emphasized the sensory impression of a scene rather than its exact
      details, forever changing the landscape of art. '
    - Explore the exhibition to uncover how Berthe Morisot, a trailblazing figure
      of Impressionism, not only shaped the movement but also inspired international
      artists to adopt and evolve her innovative techniques.
    - After immersing yourself in the exhibition, you'll have the opportunity to
      participate in a plein air painting tutorial, where you can choose to adopt
      the Impressionist technique or explore a style of your own. Your creation can
      then be submitted to an international exhibition.
